CI/CD PIPELINE USING GIT, JENKINS, MAVEN

Step 1: Setup Jenkins Server
The first step in setting up a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins is to set up a Jenkins server. You can do this by downloading the Jenkins installer from the official website (https://www.jenkins.io/download/) and installing it on your local machine or a server.

Step 2: Run 1st Jenkins Job
Once you have installed Jenkins, the next step is to create your first Jenkins job. You can do this by logging in to the Jenkins web console, clicking on the "New Item" button, and selecting "Freestyle project". From there, you can configure your job to execute any build script or command. 

Step 3: Integrate Git with Jenkins
To integrate Git with Jenkins, you will need to install the Git plugin on your Jenkins server. You can do this by navigating to the "Manage Jenkins" page, clicking on "Manage Plugins", and searching for the Git plugin. Once you have installed the plugin, you will need to configure Jenkins to connect to your Git repository.

Step 4: Run Jenkins Job to Pull Code from GitHub
With Git integrated into Jenkins, you can now create a Jenkins job that pulls code from your Git repository. To do this, create a new Jenkins job and configure it to pull code from your repository. You will need to provide Jenkins with your Git repository URL, authentication credentials (if required), and any other necessary configuration settings.

Step 5: Integrate Maven with Jenkins
To integrate Maven with Jenkins, you will need to install the Maven plugin on your Jenkins server. You can do this by navigating to the "Manage Jenkins" page, clicking on "Manage Plugins", and searching for the Maven plugin. Once you have installed the plugin, you will need to configure Jenkins to use Maven for building your Java projects.

Step 6: Build a  Project Using Jenkins
Now that you have Git and Maven integrated into Jenkins, you can create a Jenkins job that builds your  project. To do this, create a new Jenkins job and configure it to pull code from your Git repository, compile your Java code using Maven, and package your applicatio

Step 7: Build is Failing
If your build is failing, there are several things you can do to troubleshoot the issue. First, check the Jenkins console output to see if there are any error messages or stack traces that indicate what went wrong. You can also try running the build manually from the command line to see if you get the same error. If the issue persists, you may need to review your build script or configuration settings to ensure that everything is set up correctly.

INTEGRATING TOM CAT SERVER IN CI/CD PIPELINE

Step 1: Setup a Tomcat Server
First, we will need to set up a Tomcat server. We can download the Tomcat installer from the official website and install it on a server.


Step 2: Integrate Tomcat with Jenkins
To integrate Tomcat with Jenkins, we will need to install the Tomcat plugin on our Jenkins server. We can do this by navigating to the "Manage Jenkins" page, clicking on "Manage Plugins", and searching for the Tomcat plugin. Once we have installed the plugin, we will need to configure Jenkins to connect to our Tomcat server.

Step 3: Deploy Artifacts on a Tomcat Server
With Tomcat integrated into Jenkins, we can now create a Jenkins job that deploys our artifacts on the Tomcat server. To do this, we will create a new Jenkins job and configure it to deploy the artifacts generated by our build job to the Tomcat server. We will need to provide Jenkins with our Tomcat server URL, authentication credentials (if required), and any other necessary configuration settings.
